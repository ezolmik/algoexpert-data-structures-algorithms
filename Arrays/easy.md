#### Two Number Sum
Write a function that 
- takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum
- If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order.
- If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
```
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
  return []
```
- You can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum
- You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

#### Valid Subsequence
- Given two non-empty arrays of integers
- Write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
- A subsequence of an array is a list of numbers that are in the same order as in the array.
- For example: `[1,3,4]` and `[2,4]` are both subsequences of `[1,2,3,4]`
```
def isValidSubsequence(array, sequence):
  return False
```

#### Sorted Squared Array
Write a function that 
- takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order
- and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
```
def sortedSquaredArray(array):
  return []
```
